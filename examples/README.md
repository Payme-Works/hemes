# Examples

This folder contains Hemes examples for different brokers and types of actions. All of
them were tested and may work properly. You can also customize them for your
needs.

## Add an example

If you'd like to submit an example, make sure it hasn't been proposed yet. To get started,
create your new example on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), test it and make sure it works as expected. When it's ready, open a PR to add it on this folder (we recommend you create the example for both JavaScript and TypeScript, but that's not required).

Also, don't forget to add a Usage example and the action on the file. So it's super easy to test it out!
